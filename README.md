This project is a stock price prediction tool I built using a type of neural network called LSTM. I trained the model to predict future closing prices based on historical data from Tata Global Beverages (NSE).

I also made a dashboard using Dash where:

You can see the actual vs. predicted closing prices of Tata Global stock

You can select companies like Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple from a dropdown and view:

Their high and low prices over time

Their trading volume

The app is fully interactive â€” so users can explore the data by choosing the company and adjusting the timeline.
